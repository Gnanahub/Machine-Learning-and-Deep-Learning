In this folders the data will be stored in images as image with unique numbers using a library called "uuid"
all the Images in images folder are converted into json file which stored into labels folders. ( to read the image),
later the data is seperated by train, test and val. 

for example: 
if we have all the images count = 213
213 will convert into json file and stored into labels folder. now 213 will divide by 70/30, ( 70 to train and 30 to test and val(15 each))

let's do a small calculation, so we can know how the data is distributed:
213*.7 = 149.1~ 150   # 150 to train
213*.15 = 31.95 ~ 32   # 32 and 31 to test and val

later in train, test and val folders, I've created 2 sub folders in every folders named (images and val) 

we have to divide the images and json files too. which distributing in train, test, val.

Note: I've not uploaded any images cause all the images are confidential, you can add your own images in image folder. 
using augment images will generate 30X times.
